React SP Meetups
===

So I came with this crazy idea about doing meetups on React.

### How I see it:

1. We get speakers, around 1-2 speakers per meetup
2. The session will last around an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. To be a speaker on a next meetup just send a PR to `interestedSpeakers.md` with your short bio and a very short outline of what you'd like to talk about.
5. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
6. More to follow, stay tuned!

### When:

The meetup will be organised whenever we will have enough speakers (1-2), still not sure how much interest this thing will get. Hoping for one every month.

#### The next and the first meetup

To be defined (in SÃ£o Paulo)
